    "changelog": "### Fixes\n- Ensure assemblies are removed from the Included Assemblies field if they no longer exist (case [1318668](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/code-coverage-the-included-assemblies-field-shows-assemblies-that-no-longer-exist))\n- Ensure invalid or hidden sequence points are ignored (case [1372305](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/class-which-derives-from-methodbase-causes-incorrect-sequence-points-to-be-generated-by-coverage-api)). Note that this fix is temporarily applied to the Code Coverage package and will be moved to the [Coverage API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TestTools.Coverage.html) in the engine in the future.\n\n### Changes\n- Updated Report Generator to version 4.8.13\n- Renamed *assemblyFilters* aliases in [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html); `<user>` was renamed to `<assets>` and `<project>` was renamed to `<all>`.\n- Replaced `pathStrippingPatterns` with `pathReplacePatterns` in [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html). The `pathReplacePatterns` option allows stripping and replacing specific sections from the paths that are stored in the coverage results xml files.\n\nSee the [Upgrade guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/upgrade-guide.html) if upgrading to Code Coverage package version 1.2\n\n### Improvements\n- The size of the coverage result files and the Code Coverage session duration have been optimized. When more than one coverage xml result files are generated within a Code Coverage session, these files now include only the coverage data of the visited lines. Then, at the end of the session a final coverage xml result file is generated which includes all the lines but with zero coverage.\n- Added Help IconButton in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html)\n- Refactored the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) UI to include a new *Report Options* section and removing the word 'Generate' from options\n- Introduced new selection buttons under the *Included Assemblies* dropdown in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html); use the *All* button to select all the assemblies in the project. Use the *Assets* button to select only the assemblies under the `Assets` folder. Use the *Packages* button to select only the Packages' assemblies. If searching, the buttons will apply only to the assemblies visible in the list.\n- Added [What's new](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/whats-new.html) and [Upgrade guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/upgrade-guide.html) pages in the documentation\n- Added [Using relative paths in path filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html#using-relative-paths-in-path-filters) section in documentation\n- Updated documentation to match version 1.2.0-exp.7\n\n### Features\n- Added `Test Runner References` coverage report option in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which if checked generates references to tests allowing viewing coverage per test. Note that this option affects Test Runner Coverage sessions only.\n- Added `generateTestReferences` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows viewing coverage per test\n- Added `pathFiltersFromFile` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows specifying an external file which contains a list of path filters. When this file contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories.\n- When the `pathFilters` option in *-coverageOptions* contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories."
