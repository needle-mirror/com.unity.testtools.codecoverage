    "changelog": "### Fixes\n\n- Fixed the filtering and reporting of package's paths that were reported relative to the current project instead of absolute.\n- Fixed a NullReferenceException that could occur while computing cyclomatic complexity.\n- Fixed references to the deprecated EditorAnalytics methods for release streams from 6000.0 or newer (case [COV-44](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sample-editoranalytics-warning-when-enabilg-code-coverage-in-the-sample-project))\n- Fixed playmode tests failing in the _Asteroids sample project_ (case [COV-54](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multiple-tests-are-failing-in-the-code-coverage-sample-asteroids-project))\n- Fixed pink materials to be rendered for URP in _Asteroids sample project_\n- Updated the Input System in _Asteroids sample project_ to use the new Input System package instead of the legacy one (case [COV-52](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asteroids-sample-project-is-not-updated-for-the-new-unity-streams))\n- Fixed _assembliesInclude_/_assembliesExclude_ parsing in `filtersFromFile` when running in the command line in `non-batchmode`\n\n### Changes\n\n- Raised the minimum supported Unity version for the Code Coverage package to 2021.3 and updated the codebase to align with this new dependency.\n- Updated dependency packages versions: `com.unity.test-framework` to v1.4.5 and `com.unity.settings-manager` to v2.0.0.\n- The entries in the `pathFilters` option in _-coverageOptions_ are now processed in order so a subset path can be included even if the parent path is excluded. Previously all exclusions were processed before any inclusions.\n- Removed the `CoverageFormat` class, as there are currently no plans to support any other raw coverage formats other than OpenCover.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Reduced the needed time to apply path filtering during the report generation.\n- Migrated Mono APIs to CoreCLR-compatible APIs.\n- Documentation: Added a note about the Input System package dependency in the [Code Coverage tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.3/manual/Quickstart.html) page.\n- Documentation: Fixed broken links in the [Code Coverage tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.3/manual/Quickstart.html) page."
