# About Code Coverage

Use the Code Coverage package with the [Test Runner](CoverageTestRunner.md) to gather and present test coverage information. When you run your tests with code coverage enabled you can see exactly which lines of your code are executed when the tests run in addition to whether the tests passed or failed. See [Using Code Coverage with Test Runner](CoverageTestRunner.md).

Once a test run has completed, the Code Coverage package will generate an [HTML coverage report](HowToInterpretResults.md) showing which lines of your code are covered by tests. Code Coverage currently supports **EditMode** and **PlayMode** tests. It also allows you to track the code coverage changes through time.

Additionally, the Code Coverage package offers a [Coverage Recording](CoverageRecording.md) feature which allows capturing coverage data on demand.

The Code Coverage package is available as a preview package via the Package Manager for Unity 2019.3 and above. See [Installing Code Coverage](InstallingCodeCoverage.md). Please make sure to enable preview packages in the Package Manager, otherwise it won't be listed.
